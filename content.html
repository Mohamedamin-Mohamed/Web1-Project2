       <h1>About my Blog</h1>
       <p>I made this blog to show you about the features of the Kenyan Wildlife.  There is so much to talk about Kenya that it is hard to narrow it down to a small list, but here are a few of the best features of the wildlife in Kenya.</p>
       <br/><br/>
      
       <h2>Overview</h2>
       <p>Kenya has some of the most beautiful and diverse landscapes on Earth. From tropical forests to dryer grasslands, the variety of these ecosystems holds wildlife of all kinds. 
           The most common biome here is the Savanna. The Savanna is sort of a tropical grassland. This landscape can be identified by the miles and miles of grass across rolling hills with the occasional tree or bush scattered around. 
           Because it is located near the equator, the temperature stays almost the same year-round at about 25 degrees Celsius, or about 77 Fahrenheit. 
           It does not have the typical four seasons like other areas around the world, instead, it just has two, the rainy season and the dry season.
            The dry season is about the same time as winter, and the rainy season is during the months of summer.

           <h2>Plants</h2>
           <p>
            The savanna here in Kenya is home to some very rare yet beautiful plants. Although most of it is covered by a variety of different types of grass including lemongrass, bermudagrass, star grass, and Rhodes grass, there are others. 
            There are still trees and bushes scattered across the plains. One of the most common types of trees found here is the acacia tree. This tree is the one that looks similar to an umbrella. 
            It goes straight up then branches out providing a little bit of shade across the vast sea of grasses. You will often see many different types of animals lounging underneath these trees trying to get protection from the hot sun beating down. 
            One of the most unique looking trees in the world can be found here. 
            The Baobab tree looks as if it comes from an alien planet. Its thick trunk extends straight up for dozens of feet until it branches out only at the very top with tiny little branches. 
            These unique plants provide an environment that allows a perfect place for even more unique animals to thrive in.

           <h2>Animals</h2>
           <p>
            Kenya provides some of the most unique and impressive animals that can be recognized all over the world. While visiting, you will be sure to see some that you will likely never forget. 
            We could make a list and go on and on about all the incredible animals, but we chose to narrow it down to a few of the best of the best that you will see on your journey here to Kenya. 
            To start it off, we have the African lion. The king of the jungle as some call it, this majestic creature thrives here in these grasslands. These animals live in groups, or prides as they call them. 
            If you see one, you will likely see it with about 10-15 other of these massive cats. Staying on the topic of cats, another one of these spectacular creatures is the cheetah. 
            The cheetah is the fastest land animal on earth. It can reach running speeds of up to 70 mph. Another spotted animal found here in Kenya is the giraffe. 
            This is the tallest land creature on the planet. With their necks extending from their bodies, they can reach heights of up to 20  feet tall. 
            Although giraffes are gigantic, they are not the biggest animal that can be found here. That title belongs to the African elephant. 
            These giants stand at 10 feet tall and weigh over 13,000 pounds. If you get the chance to see one of these fantastic creatures while in Kenya, it is truly a sight to behold.
